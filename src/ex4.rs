// Box<Thing> behaves very differently from `Thing` and `&Thing`.
//
// A detail we've been avoiding due to something special with `Thing`.
//
// But it is *not* something special about `Box`; it is *Thing* that
// is special; discuss.


// EXERCISE: add a new function, `increment_count`, that takes a
// `Thing` and adds 1 to its count field in a way that the *caller*
// can observe.
